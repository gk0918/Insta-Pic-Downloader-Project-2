The Instagram Profile Picture Downloader is a user-friendly application designed to effortlessly
retrieve high-resolution profile pictures from any Instagram account, regardless of follow status.
Users simply enter the desired username, and the program automatically creates a dedicated folder
named after that username. Inside this folder, the high-resolution profile picture is saved in PNG
format, along with a zip file containing the username and a text file with the user's Instagram ID. 
This tool is ideal for personal use, research, and social media management, providing a streamlined
process for accessing and organizing profile images efficiently.
